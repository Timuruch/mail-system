DEF_LOG_PRT - 1024
CMD_PRT_RANGE = from 2000 to 3000
WK_PRT_RANGE = from 4000 to 5000




username@ip - basic tocken of my mail

so basically client after user wrote it up in it
takes the ip out of the token and tries to connect
to server (default port is 40), and after connection <----- Because of some restrictions 
is estabilished, it asks if it has a user with this	    Port 40 is not used anymore
username, if yes it locks in, and waits for the 	    instead port 1024 is.
password (the server waits). 

but person can dont use a command port, instead
only ask if there is a mail, if not leave.

Then after authentication is passed, it gives a 
command port (100-700, CMD_PRT) which is used
by a client and a server for Alert of Configuraion
purposes (can be changed in future). If the server
or client wants to send a file/mail/feedback 
it makes a request (if client), or gives a work
port (if server).

Usually WK_PRT is from 1000 to 1700 to prevent
with collisions with CMD_PRT.

Example:
	Client requests to send a mail to server:
		C: RQ?		(REQUEST?)
		S: WP 256 	(WORK PORT IS 256)
		(then it is proceded on the other side)
	
	Server makes an annoucement: (the client should be ready to get new mail)
		S: NM		(NEW MAIL)
		C: WP?		(WORK PORT?)
		S: WP 256	(WORK PORT IS 256)
		(then it is procceded on the other port)

Authentication Example:
	Client connects to server:
		C: LSRQ? 	(LOGIN SEARCH REQUEST?)
		S: USNRQ 	(USERNAME REQUEST) //can say no auth needed, temp mail server
					(your mail exists only when you are in,
					but the problem everybody can use it)
		C: USNM rdst 	(USERNAME IS rdst)
		S: OK PSRQ 	(OK PASSWORD REQUEST) or also NO USR
		C: PS 1234	(PASSWORD IS 1234)
		S: OK		(OK)
		C: NW?		(NEW MAIL?)
		S: Y 1		(YES 1 NEW MAIL) or NO
		C: CMDP?	(CMD_PRT?)
		S: CP 256	(COMMAND PORT IS 256)
		C: BYE		(CLOSURE OF CONN. WITH Server)
		(end of transmission)
