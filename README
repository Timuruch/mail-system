So this is my pet project, simple mail service for computers in local Network. Perfect solution for economing traffic inside an office, or prevent leakege from secret files... Anyways give feedback. My advice is to compilate them by yourself, because these ones are still to raw to be compilated by myself, for release. But in future when we will get to the release, there would be two revisions for linux and windows. Hope u will have fun, every feedback is good! so leave smth. in comment section! (:
